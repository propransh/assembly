    prompt = f"""Proposition: {topic}

Entities from knowledge graph:
{entity_list}

Knowledge graph context:
{graph_context}

For each real stakeholder, analyze their fundamental interests and derive their logical stance.

Think through each stakeholder like this:
1. What does this entity fundamentally want? (profit, power, safety, freedom, etc.)
2. How does this proposition affect those interests?
3. What stance do those interests logically push them toward?

IMPORTANT: Do NOT default everyone to the same stance. Real debates have genuine disagreement.
For any regulation topic — some entities genuinely benefit from regulation, others genuinely lose.
Derive that from interests, not from what today's news says they support.

Respond in this exact JSON format:
{{
    "stakeholders": [
        {{
            "name": "entity name exactly as given",
            "category": "tech_company/government/civil_society/academic/labor_union/consumer/media/investor/affected_community/international_body",
            "fundamental_interests": "what this entity fundamentally wants in 1 sentence",
            "interest_analysis": "how this proposition affects their interests in 1-2 sentences",
            "real_position": "their logical position derived from interests, NOT their public PR stance",
            "stance": "for/against/neutral",

            "relevance_score": 0.85
        }}
    ]
}}

Rules:
- Stance comes from INTEREST ANALYSIS, never from public statements or news sentiment
- Ensure genuine diversity — not everyone can have the same stance
- A tech company might be AGAINST regulation (threatens profits) OR FOR it (legitimizes industry, hurts competitors)
- Derive which one from their specific situation in the graph context
- Maximum 15 stakeholders
- Only include entities with a genuine stake"""
